## Planning and Preparation:
The preparation stage involved setting clear and prioritized goals that were integral to the project's success. These included essential elements like planning, playable map creation, animations, entities, map design, game enjoyment, bug-free completion, and game publishing. Additionally, learning Unreal Engine 5 and Blender was a vital part of the preparation.

The sources of information utilized were varied, including tutorials, community resources, and prior knowledge, which significantly aided in the learning process. Specific tools within Unreal Engine, like Landscape Tool, Selection Tool, Foliage Tool, Mesh Paint Tool, Animation Tool, and Asset Editing, were instrumental in executing various aspects of the project.

## Task Execution and Management:
The execution phase was meticulously planned with a detailed day-by-day breakdown of tasks. However, challenges arose during the planning process, primarily due to setting too many daily goals and the loss of planning documents. These setbacks prompted a shift in strategy towards smaller, achievable tasks that could be completed within shorter time frames.

Despite facing these challenges, the project execution proceeded with a focus on programming, Blender work, testing, debugging, and reviewing the progress. While not all goals were fully accomplished due to time constraints, the project still reached a satisfactory stage, albeit not meeting all expectations.

## Decision-Making Process:
Decisions were crucial in shaping the project's direction. Opting for game development over website creation was based on existing experience and a more enjoyable journey. The choice of Unreal Engine 5 over Unity was due to familiarity and comfort working with the software. The decision to create a horror game set in a forest stemmed from a personal interest in horror games and the eerie ambiance of a dark forest, providing a captivating setting for the game.

## Reflection on Process:
The realization of the IPERKA project involved reflection on the challenges encountered during planning, task execution, and decision-making. Adjustments made during the planning phase led to a more effective strategy. While some goals were not fully met, the project was propelled forward by the focus on smaller, achievable daily tasks.

## Lessons Learned:
Lessons from the project included the importance of adaptability, prioritization, and a clear understanding of personal constraints. The solo management of the project allowed for independent decision-making and the exploration of innovative ideas.

The meticulous breakdown of the planning and realization processes, along with the insights gained from the decisions made and challenges faced, contributed to the overall progression and development of the IPERKA project.
