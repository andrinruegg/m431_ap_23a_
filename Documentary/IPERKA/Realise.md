# How I approached the tasks:
When you look at the planning: [Plan.md]: https://github.com/andrinruegg/m431_ap_23a_/blob/main/Documentary/IPERKA/Plan.md
You can see the multiple tasks I set myself. Before starting out, I always informed myself about the things I do. An example is how I should create a map. I looked up for tutorials and then I just did my tasks. If i was happy with the completed task, I went to the next one. After every task I also checked if the task was done right.

# Setup Tasks:
At the beginning, I had to download multiple apps: Epic Games and Blender. Then, on Epic Games, I had to download various versions of Unreal Engine. Initially, I tried downloading the newest version (5.3). 
Unfortunately, when I attempted to open the app, it consistently crashed. The reason for this was an old driver.  <br>
I went to the official Intel website, downloaded the app, and obtained the latest version for my CPU (Intel Core i7, 11th gen).  <br>
Before arriving at that solution, I acquired Unreal Engine 4. <br>
However, I lacked experience with it, and it also had outdated tools, so I tried finding another way to handle that problem. With the necessary apps installed, I began educating myself. I watched simple tutorials for UE5 and Blender and started experimenting on my ow.  <br>
Before commencing map-making (one of my first tasks), I tested features like landscaping and various cool add-ons such as the easy building system. <br>
I created a small island for experimentation. <br>
The map-making process took longer than expected because I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br>
I acquired numerous textures and 3D models from the internet and aimed to create a realistic forest. Additionally, I implemented sounds. now form that text so that it would look good on an git repository.

By the way, I also made a small tutorial Video how to make an Horror Enviroment ðŸ˜„: https://youtu.be/7xzplbQVI2Y <br> <br>

The knowledge I gathered was drawn from diverse sources including tutorials, community resources, and my own prior experience, significantly aiding the learning process. Utilizing specific tools within Unreal Engine such as the Landscape Tool, Selection Tool, Foliage Tool, Mesh Paint Tool, Animation Tool, and Asset Editing proved instrumental in realizing various aspects of the project.

## Task Execution and Management:
The execution phase was meticulously organized with a detailed, day-to-day task breakdown. However, challenges arose during the planning phase due to overloading myself with excessive daily goals and the unforeseen loss of planning documents. These challenges prompted a pragmatic shift in strategy towards smaller, achievable tasks, ensuring they could be completed within manageable time frames.

## Despite these challenges, I directed my focus on programming, Blender work, rigorous testing, debugging, and consistent progress reviews. Although not every goal was fully accomplished due to time constraints, the project advanced to a satisfactory stage, even though it did not meet all initial expectations.

## Decision-Making Process:
Decisions played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of the project. Opting for game development over website creation was grounded in the enjoyment and familiarity I experienced with game development. The choice of Unreal Engine 5 over Unity was influenced by my comfort and proficiency with the software. Creating a horror game set in a forest stemmed from a personal affinity for the suspense and ambience characteristic of such settings in horror games.

## Reflection on Process:
Reflecting on the IPERKA project involved considering the challenges encountered during planning, task execution, and decision-making. Adaptations made during the planning phase led to a more effective strategy. While not all goals were achieved as intended, focusing on smaller, feasible daily tasks steered the project forward.

## Lessons Learned:
This project instilled valuable lessons in adaptability, prioritization, and a better understanding of personal limitations. Managing the project independently allowed for the exploration of innovative ideas and independent decision-making.

## The meticulous breakdown of planning and realization processes, along with the insights gained from decision-making and challenges faced, significantly contributed to the overall progression and development of the IPERKA project.
