# Realise 
Before hopping in, please check out this small gameplay: [https://youtu.be/QzJG0K9xBcc] <br>
Here are a few Pictures of my project where I want to show off the realistic graphic:

# How I approached the tasks:
When you look at the planning: [Plan.md]: https://github.com/andrinruegg/m431_ap_23a_/blob/main/Documentary/IPERKA/Plan.md
You can see the multiple tasks I set myself. Before starting out, I always informed myself about the things I do. An example is how I should create a map. I looked up for tutorials and then I just did my tasks. If i was happy with the completed task, I went to the next one. After every task I also checked if the task was done right.

# Setup Tasks:
At the beginning, I had to download multiple apps: Epic Games and Blender. Then, on Epic Games, I had to download various versions of Unreal Engine. Initially, I tried downloading the newest version (5.3). 
Unfortunately, when I attempted to open the app, it consistently crashed. The reason for this was an old driver.  <br>
I went to the official Intel website, downloaded the app, and obtained the latest version for my CPU (Intel Core i7, 11th gen).  <br>
Before arriving at that solution, I acquired Unreal Engine 4. <br>
However, I lacked experience with it, and it also had outdated tools, so I tried finding another way to handle that problem. With the necessary apps installed, I began educating myself. I watched simple tutorials for UE5 and Blender and started experimenting on my ow.  <br>
Before commencing map-making (one of my first tasks), I tested features like landscaping and various cool add-ons such as the easy building system. <br>
I created a small island for experimentation. <br>
The map-making process took longer than expected because I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br>
I acquired numerous textures and 3D models from the internet and aimed to create a realistic forest. Additionally, I implemented sounds. now form that text so that it would look good on an git repository.

By the way, I also made a small tutorial Video how to make an Horror Enviroment ðŸ˜„: https://youtu.be/7xzplbQVI2Y <br> <br>
This is a shortened video down to 7 minutes. It took a few hours to edit and create so please watch it! (Also dont forget to subscribe to my channel for more!)

The next task was creating an entity: I tryed many things I went on Blender and tried crweating sdome scary characters for my game but i just wasnt able to do that. The probloem: I made characters and implemented them in the game buit they didnt have a skeleton so animations didnt work on them. I tried everythoing. In the end I gave up with idea but then i cam up with soemthing. UE5 has a simple character for everyone who starts out and i took that playable character and shanged it in game. It already had a skeleton so it was easy. I created new textures and made the entity red and not good visible in the dark. i ALSO CHANGED THE SIZE OF THE CHARACTER SO THAT IT IS 1.5x bigger then the official player. Then I had problems with the animations again as I tried creating an simple ai system where he can follow the player. I made it so that the entity follows the palyer when he sees him but that changed the animatzions somehow. Sadly that was a problem I copuldnt fix. Now when he sees you he runs to you but it looks abit wierd. But i didnt stay long wioth that problem because I knew I couzldnt fix it. So I went further. I changed the game mode. At ebgining it was a simple third person mode but I changed it to first person: Here is how I did it: I started out with creating an follow cammera. I set it into the players head but it looked wierd as I couldnt move my head in the game so I could just look forward. Then to fix that, I attached the cammera to the head socket the head so that it looks like first person as It sees everywhere where my head moves so I can turn 360Â°. I removed the sky so it got dark then it was creepier. I added a fog into the game and changed the location to the palyers height i made the fog density higher and the fog itself dark grey. Now when you played you couldnt see anything in thed game as there was no light and justt a dark fog. My next idea was to add a light to the cammera. I attached it also to the socket and changed the strength of the ligfht a bit and also the field where it can look. Also i chnaged the field of view from the cammera to 110Â° as it makes the first person mode look more scary. 

The knowledge I gathered was drawn from diverse sources including tutorials, community resources, and my own prior experience, significantly aiding the learning process. Utilizing specific tools within Unreal Engine such as the Landscape Tool, Selection Tool, Foliage Tool, Mesh Paint Tool, Animation Tool, and Asset Editing proved instrumental in realizing various aspects of the project.

## Task Execution and Management:
The execution phase was meticulously organized with a detailed, day-to-day task breakdown. However, challenges arose during the planning phase due to overloading myself with excessive daily goals and the unforeseen loss of planning documents. These challenges prompted a pragmatic shift in strategy towards smaller, achievable tasks, ensuring they could be completed within manageable time frames.

## Despite these challenges, I directed my focus on programming, Blender work, rigorous testing, debugging, and consistent progress reviews. Although not every goal was fully accomplished due to time constraints, the project advanced to a satisfactory stage, even though it did not meet all initial expectations.

## Decision-Making Process:
Decisions played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of the project. Opting for game development over website creation was grounded in the enjoyment and familiarity I experienced with game development. The choice of Unreal Engine 5 over Unity was influenced by my comfort and proficiency with the software. Creating a horror game set in a forest stemmed from a personal affinity for the suspense and ambience characteristic of such settings in horror games.

## Reflection on Process:
Reflecting on the IPERKA project involved considering the challenges encountered during planning, task execution, and decision-making. Adaptations made during the planning phase led to a more effective strategy. While not all goals were achieved as intended, focusing on smaller, feasible daily tasks steered the project forward.

## Lessons Learned:
This project instilled valuable lessons in adaptability, prioritization, and a better understanding of personal limitations. Managing the project independently allowed for the exploration of innovative ideas and independent decision-making.

## The meticulous breakdown of planning and realization processes, along with the insights gained from decision-making and challenges faced, significantly contributed to the overall progression and development of the IPERKA project.
