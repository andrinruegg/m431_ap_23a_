# Planing <br> <br>

This is an example how I planned what to do. (12.10-22.10)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Date   | Time in min | Exercise         | What has to be done                                                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12.10  |          240| Documentation    | Create a documentation file and write something to IPERKA                    |
| 13.10  |          120| Programming      | Add a playable character? Expand IPERKA                                      |
| 14.10  |           50| Programming      | Create an entity and document afterwards                                     |
| 15.10  |           20| Blender          | Create a World border and import it into the game                            |
| 16.10  |           30| Programming      | Create a simple UI and add a health, stamina system                          |
| 17.10  |           60| Programming      | Add collisions to all things that need it                                    |
| 18.10  |           30| Programming      | Expand the playable location or add a building                               |
| 19.10  |           60| Testing          | If everything is done, start testing and debugging. Write down all problems. |
| 20.10  |           30| Debugging        | Fix all the problems you can and write down how you did it.                  |
| 21.10  |           10| Review           | Review: am I happy about the result? Do I want to add something?             |
| 22.10  |          200| Upload           | Upload the game and finish the documentation.                                |

___________________________

Here is a better explanation:

- **12.10 - Documentation (240 min):** I had to restart documentating. Evem tho I have already documentated oce. The reason: I ahd no space left on my computer and accidently deleted all my files. This is one of the reasons why it took so long but atleast I still knew what to documentate

- **13.10 - Programming (120 min):** On this day, the goal was to enhance IPERKA by potentially adding a playable character and expanding the game's capabilities.

- **14.10 - Programming and Documentation (50 min):** A balance between programming and documentation, including the creation of a new in-game entity and thorough documentation.

- **15.10 - Blender (20 min):** In this short slot, the task was to design a world border in Blender, preparing it for integration into the game environment.

- **16.10 - Programming (30 min):** Focus on creating a user interface (UI) and introducing crucial game mechanics like a health and stamina system.

- **17.10 - Programming (60 min):** A dedicated hour for adding collision features to in-game elements that require them.

- **18.10 - Programming (30 min):** A continuation of programming work, with the aim of expanding the game world or adding new in-game structures.

- **19.10 - Testing (60 min):** A crucial quality assurance phase involving testing, debugging, and documentation of any issues that arose during this process.

- **20.10 - Debugging (30 min):** Addressing and documenting solutions for the identified issues, marking the debugging phase's success.

- **21.10 - Review (10 min):** Taking time to assess the project's progress and personal satisfaction, evaluating whether any additional elements or features should be added.

- **22.10 - Upload and Documentation (200 min):** The final day is dedicated to uploading the game and completing comprehensive documentation. This documentation ensures that the project is well-documented for future reference and maintenance.
