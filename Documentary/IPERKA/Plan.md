Here is a better explanation:

- **12.10 - Documentation (240 min):** The primary goal for this day was to restart the documentation process. Even though I had documented once before, I encountered a significant setback as I accidentally deleted all my files due to a lack of space on my computer. This incident also made me work slowwer because I was mad of loosing all the progress I had. However, thanks to my old knowledge and notes, I could still remember what needed to be documented.

- **13.10 - Programming (120 min):** On the 13th, the primary goal was to enhance IPERKA by potentially adding a playable character. This step improve the gameplay and user experience by alot.

- **14.10 - Programming and Documentation (50 min):** This day struck a balance between programming and documentation. The primary goal was to create a new in-game entity, after that I went back to documentating This ensured that all additions were well-captured for future reference.

- **15.10 - Blender (20 min):** In a short 20-minute slot, the primary goal was to design a world border in Blender. This design was important for the game environment so that the player couldnt escape.

- **16/17/18.10 - Programming (120 min):** The main objective for this days were to create a user interface (UI) and create game mechanics like a health and stamina system. 

- **19/20.10 - Programming (60 min):** The central goal for this days were to add collision features to in-game elements for example the trees so that they will block the player.

- **21/22.10 - Programming (30 min):** I knew from begining on that I will make the map to small at the start so I expanded it afterwards.
  
- **23.10 - Testing (60 min):** On this day, the central focus was on testing the game for bugs. The primary goal was to rigorously test the game, identify and document any issues that I found during testing.

- **24/25.10 - Debugging (120 min):** The main objective was to debugg and fix my problems.

- **26.10 - Review (10 min):** On this day, the primary goal was to think about the programm. Am I satsifyied?
  
- **27/28.10 - Upload and Documentation (200 min):** I used the final days to finish the documentation and try to upload the game.

**Challenges in My Planning Process:**

At the begining, I set myself too many daily goals, making it impossible to accomplish them all.
I lost all my planing documents after trying to get some computer storage. <br>

However, I approached this problems the right way, with just restarting  and stop crying around. I took a long time to reflect, but in the end, I adopted a more effective strategy. I began setting smaller daily tasks, each taking 30 minutes to an hour to complete.

**Problems in planing**

If you look at the table above, you'll notice that there weren't many days available. This is why I worked a bit longer at some days. The reason I got a late start was due to the loss of my documents, which left me feeling demotivated. However, I realized that I dont have much time left and I want to have a good grade. With that in mind, I pushed myself to make the most of the time I had.

Some goals werent completed: I set myself alot of goals and I knew from begining on that I couldn't complete all of them but atleast I wanted to try. At the end I still have a project, that I am fine with but sadly it hasn't reached all of my expectations.

**How I followed the plan:**

At the begining, following the plan was pretty easy for me, as there were easy task at the begining and I had much time left. But then I got slower and slower and I lost my motivation. I later then realized that I forgot to follow my plan fully. Also I let some steps out, if they took me to long, werent very important or I just wasnt able to do them.
