| Date   | Time in min | Exercise         | What has to be done                                                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12.10  |          240| Documentation    | Create a documentation file and write something to IPERKA                    |
| 13.10  |          120| Programming      | Add a playable character? Expand IPERKA                                      |
| 14.10  |           50| Programming      | Create an entity and document afterwards                                     |
| 15.10  |           20| Blender          | Create a World border and import it into the game                            |
| 16.10  |           30| Programming      | Create a simple UI and add a health, stamina system                          |
| 17.10  |           60| Programming      | Add collisions to all things that need it                                    |
| 18.10  |           30| Programming      | Expand the playable location or add a building                               |
| 19.10  |           60| Testing          | If everything is done, start testing and debugging. Write down all problems. |
| 20.10  |           30| Debugging        | Fix all the problems you can and write down how you did it.                  |
| 21.10  |           10| Review           | Review: am I happy about the result? Do I want to add something?             |
| 22.10  |          200| Upload           | Upload the game and finish the documentation.                                |

Here is a better explanation:

- **12.10 - Documentation (240 min):** The primary goal for this day was to restart the documentation process. Even though I had documented once before, I encountered a significant setback as I accidentally deleted all my files due to a lack of space on my computer. This incident also made me work slowwer because I was mad of loosing all the progress I had. However, thanks to my old knowledge and notes, I could still remember what needed to be documented.

- **13.10 - Programming (120 min):** On the 13th, the primary goal was to enhance IPERKA by potentially adding a playable character. This step improve the gameplay and user experience by alot.

- **14.10 - Programming and Documentation (50 min):** This day struck a balance between programming and documentation. The primary goal was to create a new in-game entity, alongside thorough documentation. This ensured that all additions were well-captured for future reference.

- **15.10 - Blender (20 min):** In a short 20-minute slot, the primary goal was to design a world border in Blender. This design was essential for the game environment, enhancing its visual appeal.

- **16.10 - Programming (30 min):** The main objective for this day was to create a user interface (UI) and introduce critical game mechanics like a health and stamina system. A well-designed UI and functioning game mechanics were pivotal to the user's overall experience.

- **17.10 - Programming (60 min):** The central goal for this day was to add collision features to in-game elements that required them. These collisions were vital for ensuring realism and interactivity within the game.

- **18.10 - Programming (30 min):** Continuing with programming, the primary aim was to expand the game world or introduce new in-game structures. This expansion provided players with more opportunities for exploration and interaction.

- **19.10 - Testing (60 min):** On this day, the central focus was quality assurance. The primary goal was to rigorously test the game, identify and document any issues that arose during testing, and ensure a high-quality end product.

- **20.10 - Debugging (30 min):** The main objective was to address and document solutions for the identified issues, marking the debugging phase's success.

- **21.10 - Review (10 min):** On this day, the primary goal was to assess the project's progress and personal satisfaction. This review allowed for an evaluation of whether any additional elements or features should be added to enhance the project's quality.

- **22.10 - Upload and Documentation (200 min):** The final day was dedicated to the primary goal of uploading the game and completing comprehensive documentation. This documentation ensured that the project was well-documented for future reference and maintenance.
