# Planing <br> <br>

This is an example how I planned what to do. (12.10-22.10)

| Date   | Time in min | Exercise         | What has to be done                                                          |
| ------ | ----------- | ---------------  | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12.10  |          240| Documentation    | Create a documentation file and write something to IPERKA                    |
| 13.10  |          120| Programming      | Add a playable character? Expand IPERKA                                      |
| 14.10  |           50| Programming      | Create an entity and document afterwards                                     |
| 15.10  |           20| Blender          | Create a World border and import it into the game                            |
| 16.10  |          120| Programming      | Create a simple UI and add a health, stamina system                          |
| 17.10  |           60| Programming      | Add collisions to all things that need it                                    |
| 18.10  |           30| Programming      | Expand the playable location or add a building                               |
| 19.10  |           60| Testing          | If everything is done, start testing and debugging. Write down all problems. |
| 20.10  |          120| Debugging        | Fix all the problems you can and write down how you did it.                  |
| 21.10  |           10| Review           | Review: am I happy about the result? Do I want to add something?             |
| 22.10  |          200| Upload           | Upload the game and finish the documentation.                                |

Here is a better explanation:

- **12.10 - Documentation (240 min):** The primary goal for this day was to restart the documentation process. Even though I had documented once before, I encountered a significant setback as I accidentally deleted all my files due to a lack of space on my computer. This incident also made me work slowwer because I was mad of loosing all the progress I had. However, thanks to my old knowledge and notes, I could still remember what needed to be documented.

- **13.10 - Programming (120 min):** On the 13th, the primary goal was to enhance IPERKA by potentially adding a playable character. This step improve the gameplay and user experience by alot.

- **14.10 - Programming and Documentation (50 min):** This day struck a balance between programming and documentation. The primary goal was to create a new in-game entity, after that I went back to documentating This ensured that all additions were well-captured for future reference.

- **15.10 - Blender (20 min):** In a short 20-minute slot, the primary goal was to design a world border in Blender. This design was important for the game environment so that the player couldnt escape.

- **16/17/18.10 - Programming (120 min):** The main objective for this days were to create a user interface (UI) and create game mechanics like a health and stamina system. 

- **19/20.10 - Programming (60 min):** The central goal for this days were to add collision features to in-game elements for example the trees so that they will block the player.

- **21/22.10 - Programming (30 min):** I knew from begining on that I will make the map to small at the start so I expanded it afterwards.
  
- **23.10 - Testing (60 min):** On this day, the central focus was on testing the game for bugs. The primary goal was to rigorously test the game, identify and document any issues that I found during testing.

- **24/25.10 - Debugging (120 min):** The main objective was to debugg and fix my problems.

- **26.10 - Review (10 min):** On this day, the primary goal was to think about the programm. Am I satsifyied?
  
- **27/28.10 - Upload and Documentation (200 min):** I used the final days to finish the documentation and try to upload the game.

Challenges in My Planning Process:

At the begining, I set myself too many daily goals, making it impossible to accomplish them all.
I lost all my planing documents after trying to get some computer storage. <br>

However, I approached this problems the right way, with just restarting  and stop crying around. I took a long time to reflect, but in the end, I adopted a more effective strategy. I began setting smaller daily tasks, each taking 30 minutes to an hour to complete.
