# Decide 

The creators of my game are just me, myself and I so I never had problems while deciding. I could decide everything by myself and hadnt to accept anyones other wish.
I managed my decisions in a pretty easy way. Most of the time I had multiple ideas in my mind, then i researched and after that I often had an easy decision.

Decision examples:


- **Game or Website?** (Decision made in the first two weeks) <br> <br>
  The decision between embarking on the creation of a website for my aunt, who loves decorating for others and sells her decoration online, or making my own game with Unreal Engine 5 presented was a diffciult decision. I found myself at a crossroads, as I had a certain degree of familiarity with both domains. After careful consideration, I opted to pursue game development. This choice was rooted in my existing experience in this realm, which promised a smoother and more enjoyable journey. The prospect of constructing a professional website was accompanied by the realization that it would demand a considerable investment in time and effort. Moreover, my aunt had previously sought the services of a web developer. The allure of crafting an immersive game experience and my pre-existing skill set made the decision evident.

- **UE5 or Unity?** (Decision made in the second week) <br> <br>
  The choice between Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and Unity was a matter of ease and comfort for me. I possessed an extensive background in working with UE5, making it the logical and effortless choice for my current endeavor.

When my project partner unexpectedly returned to their academic pursuits, I found myself navigating the path of a solo endeavor. This change in circumstance served as a catalyst for exploration, pushing me to seek out fresh and innovative project ideas. It demanded adaptability and a touch of creative ingenuity to adapt to this new direction. Although the initial transition presented its share of challenges, I eventually arrived at a captivating project concept. As I poured my energy into its development, it became increasingly clear that this was the path I was meant to follow.

- **What type of game?**

  There are many different types of games.
  
  Those were the once I had in mind: Horror, Jump N Run, Simulator. <br> 
  ***Why not Jump N Run:** After thinking a closer look at jump n runs it seemed pretty boring to me so I decided to dont take that one. <br> <br>
  **Why not Simulator:** I love playing simulators where you do something, earn money and then buy stuff do even earn more money, but the thing with that is, its verry hard to make and I dont have time to calculate prices and everything. <br> <br>
  **Why I chose horror:** Thinking about making a horror game, lots of ideas came in my mind. One of this were making a scary game in a forrest. Myself I enjoy playing horror games because I always need that little feeling of a shiver running down m spine after a jumpscare. <br> <br>

  **Where is the location?**
  - Forest, Murder House, Backrooms.
  <br>
  
**Why not in the backrooms?**
I love the backrooms but there are just too many games about it and also its very hard to build because there are thousands of lvls and many items and entitys. <br> <br>
**Why not in a house of a murder?**
A house of the murder would be a very cool idea but there are many similar games where you have to escape the house of a killer for example granny. In this games you also need to add many details in the house and it would be a huge effort to import that many small things. <br> <br>
**Why I chose the forest.**
I love the nature and what isn't more scarry then beiing alone in a forest at night? I have many flashbacks when I was alone in a forest and everytime I was scared so much. Also in a dark forest you cant see alot so ut was a cool idea of mine to add a flishlight what makes it even spookier as youll only have a small field of view. <br> <br>
