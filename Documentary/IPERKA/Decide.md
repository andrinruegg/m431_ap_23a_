# Decide 

The creators of my game are just me, myself and I so I never had problems while deciding. I could decide everything by myself and hadnt to accept anyones other wish.
I managed my decisions in a pretty easy way. Most of the time I had multiple ideas in my mind, then i researched and after that I often had an easy decision.

Decision examples:


- **Game or Website?** (Decision made in the first two weeks) <br> <br>
  The decision between creating a website for my aunt, who loves decorating for others and sells her decoration online, or making my own game with Unreal Engine 5 presented was a diffciult decision. I found myself at a crossroads, as I had a certain degree of familiarity with both domains. After careful consideration, I decided to do game development. Making a game is also easier for me, which promised a smoother and more enjoyable journey. Moreover, my aunt had previously hired a programmer to create her a website for her business. The other reason why I decided to programm a game is, because I already had more prior knowledge with making a game then with creating a website.

- **UE5 or Unity?** (Decision made in the second week) <br> <br>
Choosing between Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) and Unity was simple for me. I already had a lot of experience using UE5, so it made sense and was very easy for me to pick it for my current project.

When my project partner unexpectedly decided to drop out of the school to go back to his gynasium, I found myself working alone. This change pushed me to explore new project ideas, demanding flexibility and creativity. Though it was challenging at first, I eventually landed on an exciting concept. Pouring my energy into its development, I discovered it was the path meant for me. But it also helped me deciding as I didnt had to look out for others.



- **What type of game?**

  There are many different types of games.
  
  Those were the once I had in mind: Horror, Jump N Run, Simulator. <br> 
  ***Why not Jump N Run:** After thinking a closer look at jump n runs it seemed pretty boring to me so I decided to dont take that one. <br> <br>
  **Why not Simulator:** I love playing simulators where you do something, earn money and then buy stuff to earn even more money, but the thing with that is, its verry hard to make and I dont have time to calculate prices and everything. <br> <br>
  **Why I chose horror:** Thinking about making a horror game, lots of ideas came in my mind. One of this were making a scary game in a forrest. Myself, I enjoy playing horror games because I always needed that little feeling of a shiver running down m spine after a jumpscare. <br> <br>

  **Where is the location?**
  - Forest, Murder House, Backrooms.
  <br>
  
**Why not in the backrooms?**
I love the backrooms but there are just too many games about it and also its very hard to build because there are thousands of levels and many items and entities, which is impossible to create alone. <br> <br>
**Why not in a house of a murder?**
A house of the murder would be a very cool idea but there are many similar games where you have to escape the house of a killer for example granny. In this games you also need to add many details in the house and it would be a huge effort to import that many small things. <br> <br>
**Why I chose the forest.**
I love the nature and what isn't more scarry then beiing alone in a forest at night? I have many flashbacks when I was alone in a forest and everytime I was scared so much. Also in a dark forest you can't see alot so it was a cool idea of mine to add a flishlight what makes it even spookier as youll only have a small field of view. <br> <br>
