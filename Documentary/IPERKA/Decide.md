# Decide 

Decision examples:

- **UE5 or Unity?** <br>
This was a easy decision for me as I already had alot of prior eperience with UE5

I originally had different project plans, but my colleague went back to the gymnasium, leaving me to find a new project I could do alone and finish on time.

This change led me to look out for new project ideas and forced me to be adaptable and creative. While it felt challenging, it eventually came up with a good project idea. As I worked on it.
There was only one big idea in my mind afterwards, so the decision was pretty easy for me as I had no other plans.
