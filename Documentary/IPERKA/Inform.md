Prior Knowledge: I already had prior experience with these software tools which was a huge advantage. 

Refresher Videos: Watching tutorial or refresher videos was an excellent way to quickly refresh my old knowledge. Most of these videos helped me getting my old knowledge back and I didnt had to copy them 1 to 1.

Troubleshooting: Videos often covered common issues (Gorka Games did this realy well) and their solutions. They can help you troubleshoot problems more efficiently as most of the time they already know the solution to orrect the error.

Community Knowledge: Blender and Unreal Engine have active communities, and video tutorials are often created by experienced users who share their insights and tips. There is also a wiki for blender and unreal engine 5: <br> <br>

Practice and Application: After watching these videos, I pratcised some of the steps explained in the video and I could improve by alot.
