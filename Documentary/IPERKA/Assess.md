# Asses

## What will I change next time

Gather facts:

What went wrong

how often
how long
impact of it going wrong




Compare your planned progress against actual progress
Review successes:

Understand why they were a success?


Review issues encountered:

Could they have been prevented?
Did you react properly?
What can be done to prevent such issues in the future?


Ask yourselves:

If you were to start again would you do differently?
Identify areas/items that you can improve


Be constructive:

Do not fingerpoint
Use the we form: "What can we do to prevent it from happening again"
