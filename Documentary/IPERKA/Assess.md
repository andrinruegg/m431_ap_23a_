### What Went Wrong:
- **Animation:** I faced issues with my animations. Accidentally, I removed important parts from my animation blueprint, resulting in strange-looking animations.
- **Time Management:** I struggled with time management and ended up in a big stress towards the end.
- **Lag Issues:** My aim was to create a realistic horror game with high-quality graphics, but using my work laptop with outdated drivers and a poor memory card caused a lot of lag.

### Could It Have Been Avoided?
- **Animation:** I could have avoided this mistake by being more cautious and not deleting important elements without proper consideration.
- **Time Management:** If I had started with more motivation from the beginning, I might have made better progress. I also underestimated the time required to complete certain tasks.
- **Lag Issues:** Perhaps using lower-quality graphics and shaders could have prevented the annoying lag.

### Did I React Right?
- **Animation:** No, I reacted poorly by getting upset when I realized my mistake. I tried to fix it hastily, but unfortunately, I made it worse.
- **Time Management:** Towards the end, I managed my time well by dedicating more time per day to my git repository and project.
- **Lag Issues:** Yes, I adjusted the graphic settings from cinematic to low to reduce the pressure on my laptop's rendering capabilities.

### How to Avoid Such Problems in the Future?
- **Animation:** Pay closer attention to what I'm doing to avoid similar mistakes.
- **Time Management:** Begin earlier and create a more effective time plan.
- **Lag Issues:** Check for updated drivers and understand the capabilities of my computer to handle such graphics.

### If I Could Start Again, Would I Do Something Differently?
- **Animation:** Be more careful when deleting elements.
- **Time Management:** Start earlier and reconsider the time needed for tasks.
- **Lag Issues:** Consider using a more efficient device like my Comptuer at home or just use lower-quality graphics for a smoother experience.

### Where I Can Improve:
I need to get better at planning and sticking to my schedule. Many times, I didn't follow my plan, either in what I was doing or when I was doing it. Next time, I'll make a better plan and set smaller goals to stay motivated until I finish. Starting earlier will also stop me from feeling stressed at the end of the project.

This is the end of my repository. Thank you so much for reading! I hope you enjoyed it!
