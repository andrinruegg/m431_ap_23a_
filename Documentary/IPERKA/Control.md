While Testing I found many different and simple problems:

- ## X Ragdoll Issue:
In the game, I expected to have normal controls, but after playing a few times, I cycled through all the keyboard keys and discovered that pressing 'X' activated a ragdoll effect and caused the player's camera to glitch out of the map for no apparent reason. There was no purpose for the ragdoll feature, so I went to the player control blueprint and removed the keybind for 'X' to prevent this from happening.

After ragdolling you fell out of the map, as you can see here.

- ## Alt + Alt = Roll: 
During testing the keys, I found an animation that I had forgotten to delete while still experimenting. It was an animation for a roll. When pressing 'Alt' back to back, the character would perform an awkward roll. I removed this feature similarly to how I removed the ragdoll effect: by deleting the keybind in the player control blueprint.

- ## Missing Collisions: 
I noticed some trees and small rocks scattered across the map, and then realized that I forgot to create a collision for a specific tree type. To fix this, I deleted the trees, adjusted collision settings as closely as possible using the foliage editor, and enabled collisions for the brushes, ultimately resolving the issue.

- ## Entity Animation:
In the realization phase, I discussed the peculiar entity animation issue when it followed the player. To solve this, instead of creating a new animation (which would take a lot of effort), I opted to turn the entity into a ghost. Since the entity was already transparent, this seemed like a complete win. I adjusted the entity's height to make it appear as if it were flying, removed the existing animations, and now it quietly floats toward the player, creating an eerie effect.

Here you see the character T-Posing, thats how I imagine ghost flying around.

- ## First-Person Mode:
Initially, I changed from third-person to first-person mode by placing a camera in the character's head. However, at the beginning, I faced the problem of limited movement in the up-down direction. I wasn't sure how to resolve this initially, but later I discovered sockets that allow attachment of things. I connected the camera to the head socket, enabling the camera to follow the mouse's direction in all orientations, effectively solving the issue.
