### Project Overview:

Creator: This project is a one-person effort, created entirely by Andrin Rüegg (me).

Game Genre: It's a horror game, designed to scare people that hate to be alone in forests at night.

Unreal Engine 5: The game is fully made with Unreal Engine 5. 

### Other Tools Used:

Blender: Several 3D models and assets were created using Blender, a versatile 3D modeling software.

Unreal Engine 5 Assets: Some assets utilized in the project were sourced directly from Unreal Engine 5's built-in library, enhancing efficiency and quality.

Easy Building System Textures: Certain textures were obtained from the Easy Building System, a free resource available on the Unreal Engine Store. These textures contribute to the visual quality of the game.


### Game Objective:

The challenge for players is to navigate through the foggy and quiet forest and escape without falling prey to the evil entity hiding somwhere in the dark.

### Project Goal:

My main goal for this project is to give fear and excitement to the players. I want them to have an enjoyable and horrible (of corse in the creepy way) experience as they play.
